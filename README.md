<b>Will be a Pythoneer</b>

<b>Someone said,</b><br>
If you have coded in Python, you must know these terms: PYTHONIC, PYTHONIST, PYTHONEER and PYTHONISTA... So what is the meaning of those terms ?! <br>
Pythonic simply means something like "idiomatic Python". <br>
Pythoneer and Pythonista - of course - are people who love Python. For me, <b>Pythonista</b> are programmers who are real loyal fans of Python-the-language.<b>Pythoneer</b> - in my view - are the ones that always think and create new things using Python, they seems to be the ones who are likely the leaders talking about Python programming and stuffs... Well, that's just my own opinion.
